FlaskLargeProjectTemplate
=========================

This is a Flask project template that includes two modules(using blueprints). One module for web content and one for API calls. 

The aim of this template was to make a clean Flask Project Structure to base new projects on.

The main Python script is the runserver.py.

The two templates are under the app folder as mod_??? folders. These folders contrains the blueprints with the routing info for each module.

The modules also have the their own folders under the templates folder for the needed module template html files.
